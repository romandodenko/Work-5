                Presumably cricket begins its history in the 13th century and is considered a true English game. For the
                first time, cricket was mentioned in English documents, and the name comes from "cric" - the so-called
                curved shepherd's stick, which was used to lock the gates of the pasture. From this we can conclude that
                the shepherds came up with the game when they watched the herds.

                The game originated in the southeast of Great Britain, it was convenient for shepherds to play on
                pastures because there is low grass and it is convenient to roll the ball along it. They protected the
                gate with a shepherd's stick. They say it is in the UK that they are very good at forecasting cricket
                bets.

              <p class="history-top__text">
                In the 18th century the game became very popular. The beginning of this was laid by the team of the
                English village of Hambledon, who founded the Cricket Club in 1750. In 1787, the Marie-leBon Cricket
                Club (MCC) was created, which developed new rules a year later. There were no online betting sites and
                better betting apps back then, but fans were already cheering for their team and casting their votes.
              </p>
              <p class="history-top__text">
                Cricket was even included in the list of the Olympic Games, but due to the fact that it does not
                popularize this sport in many countries, cricket had to be excluded. The first championship was
                unsuccessful due to bad weather and it was not possible to determine the winner. The tournament was held
                between Australia, England and South Africa.

                  The rules of cricket are set and modified by the Marylebone Cricket Club. The club has developed a set
                  of standard rules for test or one-day matches. The game can last from 1 to 6 days. And each game is
                  divided into 2 parts, first the referee tosses a coin and chooses which team will serve.
                </p>
                <p class="history-middle__text">
                  The main task of the game is to score points, in order to score points you need to make as many runs
                  as possible. In order to make dashes, you need to toss the ball and the farther it flies, the more you
                  can make dashes. If the ball flies over the field, then it is possible to make up to 6 runs across. In
                  Cricket, points can be awarded for infringements by opponents. The defending team needs to be in
                  position, because they are the ones who earn points during this period. Knowing the rules of cricket
                  is very important in order to receive advice on online betting, and if you are no longer a beginner
                  and understand well, then you can give free advice on cricket betting

                Each team has attackers and they must be present in full force, the Bowler is the person throwing the
                ball. The serve must be straight or with one bounce off the ground at the level of the receiver's waist,
                if the angle of the serve is more than 15 degrees, this may be considered an error and an additional
                serve may be assigned to the opponents' team. Teams change roles after a specified period, when a player
                substitutes, he can only catch the ball in the field without the right to serve, beat and guard the
                wicket.

              <p class="history-bottom__text">
                A striker is a team member who receives the serve. Defenders are represented by only two batters -
                batsmen. At the end of the over, the serves go in the direction of the partner. If a batsman cannot run
                for any reason, he has the right to bring a runner to play.

                Cricket is considered to be the Indian national game, since childhood children are taught to play
                cricket. This game is even brought to religion in this country. It is not surprising that many online
                cricket betting tips come from India. Also, cricket tournaments are often held in India and bookmakers
                in India are mainly focused on this sport.
              </p>
              <p class="why__text">
                Cricket takes place on an oval-shaped field covered with grass. A pitch passes through such a field -
                this is a special earthen strip. On opposite sides of the pitch are wickets. Such gates are called
                special structures of three small columns dug into the ground. Two small wooden crossbars are placed on
                these posts.
              </p>
              <p class="why__text">
                The game was considered exclusively English, but local residents, namely the Parsis, became interested
                in the game. In 1848, the Parsis opened the first cricket club in Bombay, and over the next 20 years the
                number of such clubs grew to 30. The centuries-old competition between different confessional
                communities in India played a role in the spread of the game.

                At first, the British did not take the Indians seriously, especially their outfits and equipment, but
                subsequently changed their attitude. The Indians improved their skills and made adjustments to the form
                that made the game more comfortable. Indians have the right to consider themselves the gurus of cricket
                betting advice, as this game has become their culture.

                Cricket clothes are white. This is traditional for riets, but limited shot players usually wear clothing

                clothing to serve. Batsmen are allowed to wear a helmet with a visor to protect against blows, fielders
                who come out to the batsmen are also allowed to use helmets and leg guards.
